# PracticeEventCSharp

Practicing making events such as buttons and text boxes.

The user inputs their name into the textbox, and there are three buttons to choose from. Show Name will show what is in the textbox. Display Title will display the title of the program. Then the reset will reset the textbox to empty and the output field back to a display message.
